Secret of happy - focus one Thing at a time


Track Your Happiness by Matt Killingsworth

Ch 2) Domnio effect (geometric progression of accomplishment)
  - when I say yes to distractions; I am saying NO to my One thing, the one thing that matters the most that makes me the most happiest; since that is my singular focus in life.  Single right thing leads to happiness for being in a zone leads to Happiness.
  
Ch 1) Sad part of the book (if I get distracted this results)
  - Success feel out of reach, ... Over time they lower their expectations, abandon their dreams, and allow their life to get small.  This is very wrong thing to make small.
